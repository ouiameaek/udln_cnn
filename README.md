## Project Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the Udacity AI Nanodegree!
In this project, we build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. 
Given an image of a dog, our algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. 


## Project steps

1. Base code cloned from the repository https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git

2. Data:
* [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). 
* [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip)
* [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz)


## Results

* Checking the code: `dog_app.html`

* Running the code:

	- Install the dependencies `requirements.txt`
	- Download data sources
	- Run the code
		```
		jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
		```
